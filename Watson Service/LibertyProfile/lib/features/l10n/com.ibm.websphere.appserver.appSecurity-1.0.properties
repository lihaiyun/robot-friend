description=This feature is superseded by appSecurity-2.0. Support for securing the server runtime \
 environment and applications. This feature enables servlet-3.0 and web application security, \
 support for LDAP and basic user registries, and SSL. To support secure EJB applications, you must \
 add the ejbLite-3.1 feature. When you add this feature to your server, you need to configure a user \
 registry, such as the basic user registry or the LDAP user registry.
